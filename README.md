# SAF: Between You & the Net

## Game Description

**SAF: Between You & the Net** is a fast-paced football puzzle-arcade game built using the iGraphics library in C. Players aim to score goals against a moving goalpost , a tricky goalpost setup — one post is real, others are imposters. Some levels add puzzle-solving and goalkeeper challenges, testing the player’s accuracy, timing, and decision-making. Players can choose their jerseys, unlock levels, and celebrate with confetti.
## Features
- Moving goalposts with patterns (left–right, up–down).
- Static imposter posts that try to mislead players.
- Puzzle challenges with a 6x4 grid penalty zone.
- Goalkeeper levels for added difficulty.
- Jersey selection system (pick your kit at the start).
- Scoreboard with history and high scores.
